## Introduction

Ornament is the culmination of many discussions and explorations with the aim to
find the sweet spot in how to handle styling in large Clojure or ClojureScript
web projects. It takes ideas from CSS-in-JS approaches, and utility-class
libraries, while (in our opinion) improving on both.

At the heart of ornament is the `defstyled` macro, which defines a "styled
component". It combines a name, a HTML tag, and styling rules.

```clojure
(require '[lambdaisland.ornament :as o])

(o/defstyled freebies-link :a
  {:font-size "1rem"
   :color "#cff9cf"
   :text-decoration "underline"})
```

This does two things, first of all it creates a Hiccup component, which combines
the tag (`:a` in this case), with a class name based on the component name. (See
the section on "Choosing a Hiccup Implementation" for more info on where this
syntax is supported.)

```clojure
;; Hiccup
[freebies-link {:href "/episodes/interceptors-concepts"} "Freebies"]
```

Which renders as:

```html
<a class="lambdaisland_episodes__freebies_link">Freebies</a>
```

The styling information is rendered during a build step to CSS, and written out,
so it gets served as any other plain CSS file.

```clojure
(spit "resource/public/ornament.css" (o/defined-styles))
```

```css
.lambdaisland_episodes__freebies_link {
  font-size: 1rem;
  color: #cff9cf;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

If you prefer to use [Girouette](https://github.com/green-coder/girouette)
(Tailwind) utility classes (a.k.a. tokens), then you can do that as well, or you
can mix and match. Note that for compatibility reasons Ornament will continue to
default to Tailwind v2 components, but you can opt-in to v3, see the section
below.

```clojure
(o/defstyled freebies-link :a
  :text-base
  :text-green-500
  :underline)
```

Finally you can add one or more function bodies to your component, which acts as
a render function, determining how the children of the component will render.
Note that this render function only determines the "inside" of the component, it
will still get wrapped with the tag and class name passed to `defstyled`.

```clojure
(o/defstyled page-grid :div
  :relative :h-full :md:flex
  [:>.content :flex-1 :p-2 :md:p-10 :bg-gray-100]
  ([sidebar content]
   [:<>
    sidebar
    [:div.content
     content]]))
```

Hopefully these examples have sufficiently whetted your appetite. We'll explain
the syntax and features of `defstyled` in detail down below. But first we need
to explain Ornament's philosophy on how to deal with CSS, to give you accurate
expectations of how it will behave. This is especially relevant for
ClojureScript projects.

## Choosing your Tailwind version

We rely on [Girouette](https://github.com/green-coder/girouette) to provide us
with a re-implementation in Clojure of Tailwinds components, classes, and
styles. At time of writing Girouette is compatible with either Tailwind 2.0.3,
or 3.0.24.

To use Tailwind 3 tokens (classes), pass an extra `:tw-version 3` option to
`set-tokens!`

```clj
(o/set-tokens! {:tw-version 3})
```

See "Customizing Girouette" below for more info on `set-tokens`, or check the
docstring.

The `girouette.tw.preflight` namespace provides the Tailwind preflight (reset)
stylesheet for either v2 or v3. If you are using `o/defined-styles` you can also
opt to have it automatically prepended. This function also accepts a similar
`:tw-version` argument (`2` or `3)

```clj
(o/defined-styles {:preflight? true :tw-version 3})
```

## Choosing a Hiccup Implementation

Representing HTML using nested Clojure vectors is an approach that was
popularized by the [Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup) library, and
so this is referred to as Hiccup-syntax. Since then many other libaries have
implemented this same syntax, sometimes with small changes or extensions.

A particular extension popularized by
[Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) is the use of functions as
components. You define functions which return hiccup, and use those functions in
your hiccup where normally you would have a keyword denoting a HTML element tag.
In essence you're no longer calling the function yourself (with parentheses) but
telling Reagent to call it while rendering.

```clj
(defn my-component [arg]
  [:p "in my component:" arg])
  
(reagent-dom/render [my-component "hello"] (js/document.getElementById "app"))
```

This has significance in React-apps because it allows React/Reagent to manage
the component, but we like it in general to make it clear that something is
conceptually a hiccup component.

Ornament components are basically the same, they are (or behave like) functions
which return Hiccup. If the implementation you are using supports putting them
in square brackets then you can go with that, or you can just call them yourself
as a function.

```clj
(o/defstyled my-component :p
  :m-3)

;; option 1
[my-component "hello"]

;; option 2
(my-component "hello")
```

How do different Hiccup implementations differ?

- Clojure vs ClojureScript (or both with cljc)
- Support functions as components
- Automatically HTML-escape text (the ones that support this all have different ways of injecting "raw" html strings)
- Support for `:<>` (fragments)
- Have the style property be a map (instead of just a string)
- Pre-compile via macros for better performance

Some that we know of:

Clojure:

- Hiccup 1, beware: does not auto-escape text and so is sensitive to CSRF attacks
- Hiccup 2, fixes the security issue and is generally the better option, despite officially being in alpha
- Enlive (See `net.cgrand.enlive-html/html`)
- [lambdaisland.hiccup](https://github.com/lambdaisland/hiccup) is our take on
  this, it is based on Enlive, but adds functions-as-component, fragments,
  styles-as-maps, and a convenient syntax for raw html strings
- Hicada (cljc, macro-based)

ClojureScript

- Reagent and other React wrappers
- Sablono
- Hicada

## Ornament CSS Compilation

Ornament is written in CLJC, meaning you can call `defstyled` in ClojureScript
exactly the same way as in Clojure. But, there's one important distinction, we
do not add any styling information (be it Garden, Girouette, or CSS), to your
ClojureScript build.

This is an important design decision, and it's worth elaborating a bit. We
understand the appeal of something like CSS-in-JS from a _syntax and programmer
convenience_ point of view, and we try to offer the same kind of convenience.
However, we question that it is sensible to deal with CSS generation in
JavaScript. We think it's vastly superior to generate CSS once at build/deploy
time, and to then deal with it *as CSS*.

This pays dividends, we don't need to add all the machinery of Garden and
Girouette to the frontend build, neither do we need all the styling definitions,
so Ornament will have minimal impact on your bundle size. And your CSS can be
served — and cached — as a simple static CSS file.

What you do get from using `defstyled` in ClojureScript is a component
(function) which you can use in Hiccup (e.g. Reagent) to render HTML. The
component knows about the HTML tag to use, the CSS class name to add, and if you
added a render function, it knows about that as well.

So where does the styling go? We add that to a registry *during macroexpansion*.
In other words: in Clojure. Once all `defstyled` invocations have been compiled,
you can grab the full CSS with `(o/defined-styles)`, and spit it to a file.

Before you grab the output of `(o/defined-styles)` you need to make sure all
your styles have in fact been defined. For Clojure projects this merely means
requiring all namespaces. If you have some kind of main application entry point
that loads all your components/views, then load that, and capture the styles
once it has finished.

### ClojureScript

For ClojureScript you have two options, either you define all you components in
`cljc` files, and use the same approach as in Clojure. The alternative is to
first run your ClojureScript build, and then in the same process write out the
styles. You can for instance write your own script that invokes the
ClojureScript build API, then follows it up by writing out the styles, or you
can use something like Shadow-cljs build hooks.

#### Limitations

Keep in mind that the style (Garden/CSS) section of a component is only ever
processed in Clojure, even when used in ClojureScript files. This means that it
is not possible to reference ClojureScript variables or functions.

```clojure
(def sizes {:s "0.5rem" :m "1.rem" :l "2rem"})

(o/defstyled foo :div
  {:padding (:m sizes)})
```

This will work in Clojure, but not ClojureScript. Referencing
variables/functions inside the component body is not a problem.

```clojure
(def divider [:hr])

(o/defstyled dividers :div
  {:padding "1rem"}
  ([& children]
   (into [:<>]
         (interpose divider)
         children)))
```

This works in both Clojure and ClojureScript.

Note that it *is* possible to reference previously defined `defstyled`
components in the style rules section, even in ClojureScript, see the section
"Referencing other components in Rules" below.

```clojure
(o/defstyled referenced :div
  {:color :blue})

(o/defstyled referer :p
  [referenced {:color :red}] ;; use as classname
  [:.foo referenced]) ;; use as style rule
```

#### Computing values (referencing vars) inside style rules in cljc files

Style rules are processed during macroexpansion, which happens in Clojure, even
when compiling ClojureScript. This means that any code inside style rules needs
to be able to evaluate in Clojure by the time ClojureScript starts compiling the
`defstyled` form.

Consider this namespace

```clj
;; components.cljc
(ns my.components
  (:require [lambdaisland.ornament :as o]))

(def my-tokens {:main-color "green"})

(o/defstyled with-code :div
  {:background-color (-> my-tokens :main-color)})
```

In Clojure this works as you would expect but when compiling this as a
ClojureScript file it fails.  The failure is due to the file never being loaded
as a Clojure namespace, so the Clojure var `#'my.components/my-tokens` doesn't
exist in the Clojure environment which is where macro expansion takes place.

To fix this you can use the `:require-macros` directive which instructs the
ClojureScript compiler to load a given Clojure namespace (in this case the
current namespace) before continuing the compilation of the current namespace.

```clj
(ns my.components
  (:require [lambdaisland.ornament :as o])
  #?(:cljs (:require-macros my.components)))

#?(:clj
   (def my-tokens {:main-color "green"}))

(o/defstyled with-code :div
  {:background-color (-> my-tokens :main-color)})
```

This addresses the problem by instructing the ClojureScript compiler to first
load `my.components` as a clj namespace thereby creating the `#'my-tokens`
Clojure var. The compiler then continues with the cljs compilation and when it
gets to expansion of the `defstyled` macro form (specifically processing of the
style rule `{:background-color ...}`) the `#'my-tokens` var is available in the
clj environment and evaluated for it's value which is then included in the
Ornament style registry.

Wrapping `my-tokens` in `#?(:clj ...)` is not strictly necessary, but it helps
to emphasize the point that this definition is only ever used on the Clojure
side, you don't need it in your compiled ClojureScript.

##### Important note about CLJC files and clojure.core symbols

If you do __any__ computation in your style rules it is recommended that you
require the file as clj by utilising the `:require-macros` directive to self
require the namespace.

```clj
(ns my.components
  (:require [lambdaisland.ornament :as o])
  #?(:cljs (:require-macros my.components)))

(o/defstyled with-code :div
  {:background-color (str "red")})
```

The need for this is a subtle consequence of the same interaction between
Clojure and the ClojureScript compiler outlined in the previous section. A
similar issue will manifest if you try to use `clojure.core` symbols in your
style rules without requiring the clj namespace. This is surprising at first but
makes sense after considering that it is the `ns` form that auto refers all
`clojure.core` symbols into the current namespace. It follows that if the `ns`
form is not evaluated, because we do not require the cljc file as a clj file,
then no symbols mapping to the `clojure.core` symbols will have created in the
current namespace. The `clojure.core` symbols are however interned, and as such
fully qualifying the namespace will work but that is not an ergonomic solution. 

```clj
(ns my.components
  (:require [lambdaisland.ornament :as o]))

;; Does not work
(o/defstyled with-code :div
  {:background-color (str "red")})

;; Does work but not recommended
(o/defstyled with-code :div
  {:background-color (clojure.core/str "red")})
```

#### Shadow-cljs build hook example

This is enough to get recompilation of your styles to CSS, which shadow-cljs
will then hot-reload.

```clojure
;; Easiest to just make this a clj file.
(ns my.hooks
  (:require [lambdaisland.ornament :as o]
            [garden.compiler :as gc]
            [girouette.tw.preflight :as girouette-preflight]))

;; Optional, but it's common to still have some style rules that are not
;; component-specific, so you can use Garden directly for that
(def global-styles
  [[:html {:font-size "14pt"}]])

(defn write-styles-hook
  {:shadow.build/stage :flush}
  [build-state & args]
  ;; In case your global-styles is in a separate clj file you will have to
  ;; reload it yourself, shadow only reloads/recompiles cljs/cljc files
  #_(require my.styles :reload)
  ;; Just writing out the CSS is enough, shadow will pick it up (make sure you
  ;; have a <link href=styles.css rel=stylesheet>)
  (spit "resources/public/styles.css"
        (str
         ;; `defined-styles` takes a :preflight? flag, but we like to have some
         ;; style rules between the preflight and the components. This whole bit
         ;; is optional.
         (gc/compile-css (concat
                          girouette-preflight/preflight-v2_0_3
                          styles/global-styles))
         "\n"
         (o/defined-styles)))
  build-state)
```

```clojure
;; shadow-cljs.edn
{,,,

 ;; For best results, otherwise you will find that some styles are missing after
 ;; restarting the shadow process
 :cache-blockers #{lambdaisland.ornament}

 :builds
 {:main
  {:target     :browser
   ,,,
   :build-hooks [(my.hooks/write-styles-hook)]}}}
```

## Defstyled Component Syntax

`defstyled` really does two things, the macro expands to a form like

```clojure
(def footer (reify StyledComponent ...))
```

This "styled component" acts as a function, which is what makes it compatible
with Hiccup implementations.

```clojure
(footer "hello")
;;=>
[:footer {:class ["project-discovery_parts__footer"]} "hello"]
```

It also implements various protocol methods. You don't typically need to call
these yourself, but they can be useful for verifying how your component behaves.

```clojure
(o/classname footer)  
;;=> "project-discovery_parts__footer"
(o/tag footer)
;;=> :footer
(o/rules footer)
;;=> [{:max-width "60rem"}]
(o/as-garden footer)
;;=> [".project-discovery_parts__footer" {:max-width "60rem"}]
(o/css footer)
;;=> ".project-discovery_parts__footer{max-width:60rem}"
```

### Component Name

The first argument to `defstyled` is the component name, this will create a var
with the given name, containing the component. A function-like object that can
be used to render HTML.

The name will also determine the class name that will be used in the HTML and
CSS. For this Ornament combines the namespace name with the component name, and
munges them to be valid CSS identifiers.

```clojure
(ns my.views
 (:require [lambdaisland.ornament :as o]))

(o/defstyled footer :footer
  {:max-width "60rem"})
  
(o/classname footer)
;; my_views__footer
```

You can use metadata on the namespace to change the namespace prefix.

``` clojure
(ns ^{:ornament/prefix "views"} com.company.project.frontend.views
 (:require [lambdaisland.ornament :as o]))

(o/defstyled footer :footer
  {:max-width "60rem"})
  
(o/classname footer)
;; views__footer
```

Using fully qualified var names as class names provides the unexpected benefit
that it becomes trivial to find the component you are looking at in your
browser's inspector.

When stringifying the component you also get the class name back, this allows
using them to reference a certain class, for instance in Hiccup:

```clojure
[:div {:class (str footer)} ...]

;; Depending on your Hiccup implementation this can also work
[:div {:class [footer]} ...]

(js/querySelector (str footer))
```

### HTML Tag

The second argument to `defstyled` is the HTML tag. This is typically a keyword,
like `:section`, `:tr`, or `:div`. This is used when rendering the component as
Hiccup, and so anything that is valid in your Hiccup implementation of choice is
fair game, including `:div#some-id` or `:p.a_class`. You could also use for
instance a Reagent component, assuming it correctly handles receiving a
properties map as its first argument. You can't use `:<>` as the tag, since we
can't add a class name to a fragment.

As a special case you can use another styled component as the tag.

```clojure
(defstyled about-footer footer
  ,,,)
```

This will cause the new component to "inherit" both the HTML tag used by the
referenced componet, and any CSS rules it defines.

### Rules

After the name and tag, `defstyled` takes one or more "rules". These can be
maps, vectors, or keywords.

Maps and vectors are handled by [Garden](https://github.com/noprompt/garden),
and we recommend reading the Garden documentation and getting familiar with the
syntax. Maps define CSS styles as demonstrated before, with vectors you can
apply styles to descendant elements, or handle pseudo-elements.

```clojure
(in-ns 'my-nav)

(o/defstyled menu :nav
  {:padding "2rem"}
  [:a {:color "blue"}]
  [:&:hover {:background-color "#888"}])
 
;; Inspect the result
(o/css menu)
```

Result:

```css
.my_nav__menu{padding:2rem}
.my_nav__menu a{color:blue}
.my_nav__menu:hover{background-color:#888}
```

Keywords are handled by [Girouette](https://github.com/green-coder/girouette).
Girouette uses a grammar to parse utility class names like `:text-green-500`,
and converting the result to Garden syntax. Out of the box it supports all the
same names that Tailwind provides, but you can define custom rules, or adjust
the color palette. (See [Customizing Girouette](#customizing-girouette)).

Note that you can mix and match these. You should be able to use a Girouette
keyword anywhere where you would use a Garden properties map.

#### Referencing other components in Rules

You can use a previously defined `defstyled` component either as a selector, or
as a style rule.

Consider this "call to action" button.

```clojure
(o/defstyled cta :button
  {:background-color "red"})
```

You might use it as part of another component, and add additional styling for
that context.

```clojure
(o/defstyled buy-now-section :div
  [cta {:padding "2rem"}]
  ([]
   [:<>
    [:p "The best widgest in the world"]
    [cta {:value "Buy now!"}]]))
```

Here `cta` is a shorthand for writing the full Ornament class name of the
component. Now the `cta` button will get some extra padding in this context, in
addition to its red background.

You can also use `cta` as a reusable group of styles. In this case we want to
style the `:a` element with the `cta` styles.

```clojure
(o/defstyled pricing-link :span
  [:a cta]
  ([]
   [:a {:href "/pricing"} "Pricing"]))
```

This kind of referencing previously defined components works both in Clojure and
ClojureScript, even though in ClojureScript usage you can't normally reference
vars inside your style declaration. To make these work we resolve these symbols
during compilation based on Ornament's registry of components.

## Render functions

After the component name, tag, and CSS rules, you can optionally put one or more
render functions, consisting of an argument vector, and the function body.

```clojure
(o/defstyled with-body :p
  :px-5 :py-3 :rounded-xl
  {:color "azure"}
  ([& children]
   (into [:strong] children)))
   
[with-body "hello"]
;;=>
"<p class=\"ot__with_body\"><strong>hello</strong></p>"
```

You can put multiple of these to deal with multiple arities

```clojure
(o/defstyled multi-arity :p
  ([arg1]
   [:strong arg1])
  ([arg1 arg2]
   [:<>
    [:strong arg1] [:em arg2]]))
```

Without render functions a styled component works almost like a plain HTML tag
when using in Hiccup: the first argument, if it's a map, is treated as a map of
HTML attributes, any following arguments are treated as children.

When you supply your own render function this behavior changes. All arguments
are passed to the render function, which then determines the element's
attributes and children.

To set custom attributes on the outer element from inside the render function,
you use a properties map together with a fragment `:<>` identifier:

```clojure
(o/defstyled my-compo :div
 ([props]
  [:<> {:title "hello"} "hello!"]))
```

If you pass a `:class` here it will get added to the class that Ornament
generates for the component.

When using a component that has a custom render function, you can set attributes
by using the special `:lambdaisland.ornament/attrs` keyword.

```clojure
[my-compo {:regular-prop 123 ::o/attrs {:title "heyo"}}]
```

Any `:class` or `:style` attributes passed in this way will be added to any
classes or styles set inside the render function with `:<>`. Optionally for
`:class` and `:style` you can replace the values instead of appending by adding
a `^:replace` metadata on the vector / map.

```clojure
[my-compo {::o/attrs {:class ^:replace ["one-class" "other-class"]
                      :style {:text-color "blue"}}}]
```

In previous versions we supported `:class`, `:id` and `:style` at the top of the
properties map, but that's no longer the case.

There's an additional mechanic for setting attributes from inside the
render-function, through metadata on the return value, but it is considered
deprecated, since it's superseded by `[:<> {,,,attrs,,,}]`.

```clojure
(o/defstyled nav-link :a
  ([{:keys [id]}]
   (let [{:keys [url title description]} (get-route id)]
     ^{:href url :title description}
     [:<> title])))

;;=>
<a href="/videos" title="Watch amazing videos" class="ot__nav_link">Videos</a>
```

## Differences from Garden

The rules section of a component is essentially
[Garden](https://github.com/noprompt/garden) syntax. We run it through the
Garden compiler, and so things that work in Garden generally work there as well,
with some exceptions.

Keywords that come first inside a vector are always treated as CSS selectors, as
you would expect, but if they occur elsewhere then we first pass them to
Girouette to expand to style rules class names. If Girouette does not recognize
the keyword as a classname, then it's preserved in the Garden as-is.

That means that generally things work as expected, since selectors and Girouette
classes don't have much overlap.

```clojure
;; ✔️ :ol is recognized as a selector

(o/defstyled list-wrapper :div
  [:ul :ol {:background-color "blue"}])

(o/css list-wrapper)
;; => ".ot__list_wrapper ul,.ot__list_wrapper ol{background-color:blue}"

;; ✔️ :bg-blue-500 is recognized as a utility class

(o/defstyled list-wrapper :div
  [:ul :bg-blue-500])

(o/css list-wrapper)
;; => ".ot__list_wrapper ul{--gi-bg-opacity:1;background-color:rgba(59,130,246,var(--gi-bg-opacity))}"
```

But there is some potential for clashes, e.g. Girouette has a `:table` class.

```clojure
;; ❌ not what we wanted

(o/defstyled fig-wrapper :div
  [:figure :table {:padding "1rem"}])
  
(o/css fig-wrapper)
;; => ".ot__fig_wrapper figure{display:table;padding:1rem}"
```

Instead use a set to make it explicit that these are multiple selectors. It's
good practice to do this in general since it is more explicit and reduces
ambiguity and chance of clashes.

```clojure
(o/defstyled fig-wrapper :div
  [#{:figure :table} {:padding "1rem"}])

(o/css fig-wrapper)
;; => ".ot__fig_wrapper figure,.ot__fig_wrapper table{padding:1rem}"
```

### Garden Extensions

Ornament does a certain amount of pre-processing before passing the rules over
to Garden for compilation. This allows us to support some extra syntax which we
find more convenient.

### Special "tags"

Use these as the first element in a vector to opt into special handling. Some of
these are used where a selector would be used, others are helpers for defining
property values.

- `:at-media`

You can add breakpoints for responsiveness to your components with `:at-media`.

```clojure
(o/defstyled eps-container :div
  {:display "grid"
   :grid-gap "1rem"
   :grid-template-columns "repeat(auto-fill, minmax(20rem, 1fr))"
   :padding "0 1rem 1rem"}
  [:at-media {:min-width "40rem"}
   {:grid-gap "2rem"
    :padding "0 2rem 2rem"}])
```

- `:cssfn`

CSS functions can be invoked with `:cssfn`

```clojure
(o/defstyled with-css-fn :a
  [:&:after {:content [:cssfn :attr "href"]}])
```

- `:at-supports`

Support for feature tests via `@supports`

```clojure
(o/defstyled feature-check :div
  [:at-supports {:display "grid"}
   {:display "grid"}])
```

- `:rgb` / `:hsl` / `:rgba` / `:hsla`

Shorthands for color functions

```clojure
(o/defstyled color-fns :div
  {:color [:rgb 150 30 75]
   :background-color [:hsla 235 100 50 0.5]})

(o/css color-fns)
;;=>
".ot__color_fns{color:#961e4b;background-color:hsla(235,100%,50%,0.5)}"
```

- `:str`

Turns any strings into quoted strings, for cases where you need to put string content in your CSS.

```clojure
(o/defstyled with-css-fn :a
  [:&:after {:content [:str " (" [:cssfn :attr "href"] ")"]}])
```

#### Special property handling

Some property names we recognize and treat special, mainly to make it less
tedious to define composite values.

- `:grid-area` / `:border` / `:margin` / `:padding`

Treat vector values as space-separated lists, e.g. `:padding [10 0 15 0]`.
Non-vector values are passed on unchanged.

- `:grid-template-areas`

Use nested vectors to define the areas

```clojure
   :grid-template-areas [["title"      "title"      "user"]
                         ["controlbar" "controlbar" "controlbar"]
                         ["...."       "...."       "...."]
                         ["...."       "...."       "...."]
                         ["...."       "...."       "...."]
```

## Customizing Girouette

Girouette is highly customizable. Out of the box it supports the same classes as
Tailwind does, but you can customize the colors, fonts, or add completely new
rules for recognizing class name.

The `girouette-api` atom contains the result of `giroutte/make-api`. By
replacing it you can customize how keywords are expanded to Garden. We provide a
`set-tokens!` function which makes the common cases straightforward. This
configures Girouette, so that these tokens become available inside Ornament
style declarations.

`set-tokens!` takes a map with these (optional) keys:

- `:colors` : map from keyword to 6-digit hex color, without leading `#`
- `:fonts`: map from keyword to font stack (comman separated string)
- `:components`: sequence of Girouette components, each a map with `:id`
  (keyword), `:rules` (string, instaparse, can be omitted), and `:garden` (map,
  or function taking instaparse results and returning Garden map)
- `:tw-version`: which Girouette defaults to use, either based on Tailwind
  v2, or v3. Valid values: `2`, `3`. Defaults to v2.

```clojure
(o/set-tokens! {:colors {:primary "001122"}
                :fonts {:system "-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,Segoe UI,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,Apple Color Emoji,Segoe UI Emoji"}
                :components [{:id :full-center
                              :garden {:display "inline-flex"
                                       :align-items "center"}}
                             {:id :full-center-bis
                              :garden [:& :inline-flex :items-center]}
                             {:id :custom-bullets
                              :rules "custom-bullets = <'bullets-'> bullet-char
                                 <bullet-char> = #\".\""
                              :garden (fn [{[bullet-char] :component-data}]
                                        [:&
                                         {:list-style "none"
                                          :padding 0
                                          :margin 0}
                                         [:li
                                          {:padding-left "1rem"
                                           :text-indent "-0.7rem"}]
                                         ["li:before"
                                          {:content bullet-char}]])}]})
```

Let's go over these. Colors is straightforward, it introduces a new color name,
so now I can use classes like `:text-primary-500` or `:bg-primary`.

Fonts provide the `:font-<name>` class, so in this case `:font-system`.

With custom components there's a lot you can do. The first one here,
`:full-center`, only has a `:garden` key, which has plain data as its value.
This basically provides an alias or shorthand, so we can use `:full-center` in
place of `{:display "inline-flex" :align-items "center"}`. The second one,
`:full-center-bis` is essentially the same, but we've used other Girouette
classes. Just as in `defstyled` you can use those too.

The third one introduces a completely custom rule. It has a `:rules` key, which
gets a string using Instaparse grammar syntax. Here we're definining a grammar
which will recognize any classname starting with "bullets-" and followed by a
single character.

If `:rules` is omitted we assume this is a static token, and we'll generate a
rule of the form `token-id = <'token-id'>`. That's what happens with the first
two components.

In this case the `:garden` key gets a function, which receives the parse
information (under the `:component-data` key), and can use it to build up the
Garden styling. Notice that we're using the "bullet-char" that we parsed out of
the class name, to set the `:content` on `:li:before`.

The end result is that we can do something like this:

```clojure
(o/defstyled bear-list :ul
  :bullets-🐻)
  
[bear-list
 [:li "Black"]
 [:li "Formosan"]]
```

And get a bullet list which uses bear emojis for the bullets.

`set-tokens!` will add the new colors, fonts, and components to the defaults that
Girouette provides. You can change that by adding a `^:replace` tag (this uses
meta-merge). e.g. `{:colors ^:replace {...}}`)

## Contributing

Everyone has a right to submit patches to ornament, and thus become a contributor.

Contributors MUST

- adhere to the [LambdaIsland Clojure Style Guide](https://nextjournal.com/lambdaisland/clojure-style-guide)
- write patches that solve a problem. Start by stating the problem, then supply a minimal solution. `*`
- agree to license their contributions as EPL 1.0.
- not break the contract with downstream consumers. `**`
- not break the tests.

Contributors SHOULD

- update the CHANGELOG and README.
- add tests for new functionality.

If you submit a pull request that adheres to these rules, then it will almost
certainly be merged immediately. However some things may require more
consideration. If you add new dependencies, or significantly increase the API
surface, then we need to decide if these changes are in line with the project's
goals. In this case you can start by [writing a pitch](https://nextjournal.com/lambdaisland/pitch-template),
and collecting feedback on it.

`*` This goes for features too, a feature needs to solve a problem. State the problem it solves, then supply a minimal solution.

`**` As long as this project has not seen a public release (i.e. is not on Clojars)
we may still consider making breaking changes, if there is consensus that the
changes are justified.
